## ***SeqWeb*** _is to the_ **OEIS** _as_ **DBpedia** _is to_ **Wikipedia**.

_"...the Semantic Web is to enable people to share content ... beyond the boundaries of **strings** to the concept of **things**.”_

### Wikipedia
An extensive, community-curated online encyclopedia encompassing general knowledge in rich, narrative form, collaboratively developed and maintained by a global audience.

### OEIS

A comprehensive, community-curated online repository of integer sequences, cataloguing numerical patterns along with associated mathematical information, collaboratively expanded and refined by a worldwide network of contributors.

### DBPedia
An extensive, community-curated semantic knowledge base that augments Wikipedia, making its underlying information machine-readable, interconnected, and open for computational exploration and integration.

### SeqWeb
A comprehensive, community-curated semantic knowledge network that augments the OEIS, opening its sequence data and insights to interconnected, computational, and semantic use—enabling new forms of access, discovery, and integration with the wider landscape of mathematical and scientific knowledge.
