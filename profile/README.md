## ***SeqWeb*** _is to the_ **OEIS** _as_ **DBpedia** _is to_ **Wikipedia**.

This terse framing analogy can be useful for "quadrangulating" on the goals and substance of the SeqWeb project.

The four components of the analogy are all web resources addressible via the Internet domains `seqweb.org`, `oeis.org`, `dbpedia.org` and `wikipedia.org` respectively.

The four web entities factor natually along two axes: _subject focus_ and _content type_. 

- The _subject focus_ of both Wikipedia and DBpedia is general information, while for both the OEIS and SeqWeb it is the specialized area of mathematical integer sequences.

- Along the _content type_ dimension both Wikipedia and the OEIS present rich web pages of interlinked documents intended for human consumption.  In contrast, both DBPedia and Seqweb implement machine-readable knowledge graphs.

This framing is easily visualied by laying out the analogy as a 2-by-2 matrix.

### Wikipedia
Good ol' Wikipedia is familiar to almost everyone, but we might summarize it here as a community-curated online encyclopedia of general information subject matter, presented as web pages of formatted natural languge content, along with associated graphics, references to relevant external resources and links to other Wikipedia articles.

### OEIS
The OEIS is also a comprehensive, community-curated online encyclopedia presented as rich web pages.  However the subject matter domain is specialized around integer sequences.  It is effectively a broad catalog of knowledge in discrete mathematics, number theory and other areas that is uniquely indexed by numerical patterns.

 associated mathematical information, collaboratively expanded and refined by a worldwide network of contributors.

### DBPedia
_"...the Semantic Web is to enable people to share content ... beyond the boundaries of **strings** to the concept of **things**.”_
		—- Tim Berners-Lee, _Linked Data - Design Issues_, W3C, July 2006

An extensive, community-curated semantic knowledge base that augments Wikipedia, making its underlying information machine-readable, interconnected, and open for computational exploration and integration.

### SeqWeb
A comprehensive, community-curated semantic knowledge network that augments the OEIS, opening its sequence data and insights to interconnected, computational, and semantic use—enabling new forms of access, discovery, and integration with the wider landscape of mathematical and scientific knowledge.
